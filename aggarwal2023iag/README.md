### Description
The Insider Attack Game is a simulated real-world scenario of a network composed of six nodes (computers) with resource constranined allocation where a defender can only protect two nodes. The game evolves over four phases, each with 25 decisions. Each decision comprises two stages in which participants play the role of attackers. In the first stage of the decision, participants must choose a node to attack while defenders protect nodes (computers) by randomly allocating limited resources. In the second stage of the decision, the defender decides probabilistically to either warn the attacker that the node is defended (which could be a lie) or not provide such a warning, and then the attacker (participant) chooses to continue the attack or not.
