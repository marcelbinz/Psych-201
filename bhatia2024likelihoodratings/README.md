### Description: 

In two separate studies, a total of 300 U.S. participants rated their likelihood of engaging in 150 behaviors on a scale from 0 to 100. A rating closer to 0 indicates that participants are less likely than others to engage in a behavior, whereas a rating closer to 100 suggests that they are more likely than others to do so. The behaviors spanned five domains: health (e.g., "Buying an illegal drug for your own use"), recreation (e.g., "Whitewater rafting"), social behavior (e.g., "Ending a friendship"), ethical behavior (e.g., "Cheating on an exam"), and financial decision-making (e.g., "Betting on a poker game"). These items were drawn from DOSPERT-40 and DOSPERT-30 scales and supplemented with new items. Altogether, the data comprises 2 x 150 x 150 = 45,000 decisions. The studies were approved by the University of Pennsylvania's Institutional Review Board.
