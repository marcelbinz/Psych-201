**Description:**

This dataset includes responses from **Study 1** of the paper, which introduces the *Upscaling Effect*—a context-dependent shift in consumer preference between high-desirability (HD) and high-feasibility (HF) options.

In each trial, participants are shown a product choice scenario (e.g., backpack, speaker, TV) with either:
- Two options (HD vs. HF), or
- Three options (HD, HF, and a dominated decoy)

The presence of a **symmetrically dominated third option** significantly increases the share of HD choices. Participants respond by selecting one of the options or deferring (i.e., choosing to search for other alternatives).

**IRB Approval:**

This study was preregistered and conducted in accordance with ethical standards for human subjects research. The study received approval from the institutional review board (IRB) of the authors’ affiliated institution. Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk and provided informed consent prior to participation.
