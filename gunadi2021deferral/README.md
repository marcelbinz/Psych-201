**Description**  

This dataset contains responses from **Study 1a** of the paper. The study examined how the *direction* (increase vs. decrease) and *frequency* (single vs. multiple changes) of historical price trends influence whether consumers choose to **buy now** or **wait**.

Participants (N = 802, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk) were asked to imagine purchasing flight tickets and were shown a price trend graph modeled after Google Flights. The current price was always $398, but the historical price trend varied by condition. Participants were then asked to choose whether to purchase the tickets now or defer the purchase.

The study used a 2×2 between-subjects design:
- **Direction**: Price increased vs. decreased
- **Frequency**: Single change vs. multiple changes

**IRB Approval**  
This study was preregistered and conducted in accordance with ethical standards for human subjects research. It received IRB approval from the affiliated institution (ESADE Business School). All participants gave informed consent prior to participation.
