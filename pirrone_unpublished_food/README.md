This was a decision-making study using a classical experiment in value based decision making similar to https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2635 

Participants rated images of food and subsequently they had to perform a 2AFC task between alternatives presented at random. Participants repeated the exact same experiment twice (trials in the same order), so that we could estimate choice consistency for low and high-value pairs.

Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee at The University of Liverpool.
