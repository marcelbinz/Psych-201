# Description
- 31756 data points from 379 participants
- The data consists of four experiments in which clinical psychologists make decisions about publishing, reading, and citing 16 fictional clinical psychology research abstracts. Furthermore, in one experiment, historians make decisions about publishing 17 fictional historical research abstracts.

## Experiment Structure
Each experiment follows a similar structure with variations in the decision tasks:

### History Experiment & Psychology 1-2
- **Task**: Participants evaluate abstracts for publication decisions. After reading an abstract, they make the following decisions:
- **Responses**:
  1. Make an intuitive decision about publication
  2. Rate certainty about their publication decision (Feeling of Rightness)
  3. Decide whether to re-read the abstract
  4. Make a final considered decision about publication
  
### Psychology 3-4
- **Task**: Participants evaluate abstracts for publication decisions. After reading an abstract, they make the following decisions:
- **Responses**:
  1. Make intuitive decisions about to read the paper
  2. Make intuitive decisions about to cite the paper
  3. Rate certainty about about their decisions to read the paper
  4. Rate certainty about about their decisions to cite the paper
  5. Decide whether to re-read the abstract
  6. Make a final considered decision about to read the paper
  7. Make a final considered decision about to cite the paper
