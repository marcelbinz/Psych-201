### Description

The Phishing Training Task is designed to help participants identify Phishing emails. The task consists of three phases: pre-training, training, and post-training, during which each participant will examine 60 emails randomly selected from a dataset of 239 emails. Specifically, participants will review 40 emails during the training phase and 10 emails (8 Ham and 2 Phishing), each during the pre-training and post-training phases. Plus, during the pre- and post-training phases, participants won't receive any feedback on whether their decision was correct. In contrast, in the training phase, they will receive feedback regarding the correctness of their choices.
